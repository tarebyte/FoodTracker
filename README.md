# FoodTracker

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/tarebyte/FoodTracker.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/tarebyte/FoodTracker)

This is the food tracker app from the [Apple Developer Site](https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/referencelibrary/GettingStarted/DevelopiOSAppsSwift/index.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40015214)

I just wanted to throw it up on GitHub, in case it helps someone else
